# Backtracking #
In backtracking we move along a path to find something if we don't find 
it on that path then we back track our path to a position from where 
I can choose another path to move.

Mota-Mota khe to jo kaam recursion `undo` nahi kr pata hai usko hm manually undo krte hai aur yahi manual undo krna backtracking kh sakte hai.
